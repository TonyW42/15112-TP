Some final updates of features

1. In the ¡°sentiment analysis¡± page, the list box at the right is clickable. It means 
   that when you click on the news or the link below it, the browser would open and 
   would take you to the page. 

2. The color in the list box means something. Red means bad and green means good. The lighter
   the color is, the more good/bad it means (e.g. light red would mean ¡°very bad¡±)

3. The plot in ¡°quotes¡± is a candle plot. It is frequently used in the stock market.

4. Every time-consuming page is equipped with a process bar. The bar starts running
   when the process begins, and fills up when the process is done. 

5. You cannot sell something you do not have. If you do, you will get a error message.
